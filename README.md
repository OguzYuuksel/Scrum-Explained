XP
- impossible to gather all the requirements at the start of the project
- Gathered requirements are guaranteed to change.
- Requirements will always exceed time. 

Use scrum for planning and XP for engineering
XP		 --	 Scrum -> Terimler
Iterations	 --	Sprint
Master Story List--     Product Backlog
Customer	 --	Product Owner

Agile teams has blurred roles, all team is responsible from all work. 

Always try to have feedback from customer, try to force them to engage with you
To make team engaged, demo your software like you are presenting to the customer, see if its succesfull then find 
bad parts and retry.

Agile team consists of 2 part Customer and Development Team (take photo bölüm 1 ders 6 dk 11)
Agile analiyst -> Creates deailed lists from customer demands and onunla pazarlık yapar
agile programmer -> 
agile tester
agile project manager

Agile - you need to document as less as possible (only customer needs)


User Stories!
-> low level details will be later not here.
-> dont write tech level explanation, explain with simple terms(image 8. video 2. dk)
-> stories must be independent
-> stories must be negotiable with customer, they may change.
-> each story must be testable
-> try smaller than one week stories to show each spirit.
-> limit your stories 10-40 (3-6 months) dont go beyond now, later plan future.
-> Epics are big stories (couple weeks)
------- example story 8. video  8.33
->User story template 8. video 10.08 
->Master story list 
-> Story gathering workshop -> get together customer and development team and write user stories.
 the goal of it, estimate total project date based on story list.
for that stories must be relative each other so that you can take reference and resize others according to reference.

-> dont estimate daily, estimate points and when date is asked by customer. Multiply this points and give date to customer.
-> planning poker estimation for teams video 10 dk 12 dinle öze<3tle

-> First agile plan
- 1-5 days of stories
- Logically group stories from most important to less
- 1-6 months (first release)
- + 1-3 months for second release if needed
- 

Two options for delivery
-> deliver by date
-> Deliver by future 
-> ask your customer what to choose

Burndown chart 15. video 1.dk take photo and explain örnek chat 16. ders, bunu al yedekte tut
when something bad happened replan burndown chart and tell the customer about new date
- eğer proje çok strict ise(govornment project etc..) have two master stories list
-> First list in the beginning of project
-> second list is changes during project 


Agile iterations take image from video 19 

Test kriterlerini customer ile beraber yaz, gereksiz testler yapma, 

İterations
iteration 0 -> setup phrase (source control, development and test environments xcode setup etc...)
Meet with customer for each iterations and
- Make sure previous iteration is done.
- take feedback on last iteration stories
- plan next iteration stories with customer

you can do like asking these questions
- Have we done our homework?
- Are next iteration's stories good to go?
- Do you want additionals tests?
- This is the estimated time!
her iterasyonda sonraki iterasyona kadar olacakları müşteriye söyle ve önceki iterasyonun feedbackini al

retrospective
- find out what are we doing well? and encourage good stuff say good things
- find out where can we do even better? talk about it. share ideas 

daily standups 
- 10-15 minutes talks
- what did you do yesterday?
- what you will do today?
- sorunları nasıl çözmeyi planlıyorsun?

total of team meetings should take less than 1 hour (showcase, iteration planning, retrospective)

only fully tested complete stories will be shown in iterations, if not fullt completed, take it to the next itretaion.

refactoring code
is the practice of continuously making small, incremental design improvements to our software without changing overall external behaviour
we arent adding new fuctionality or fix bugs, instead we improve the understandibility of code.

WRITE TESTS BEFORE WRITING CODE! video 27 1. minute take this picture
first write all fail cases
second write all pass cases
third refactor code
